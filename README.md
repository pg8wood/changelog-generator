> Curbing Cumbersome Changelog Conflicts

A tool that creates changelog entries and stores them as unique files to avoid merge conflicts in version control. When it's time to release, `changelog publish` collects these files and appends them to your changelog file using a format based on [Keep a Changelog 1.0.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Why?
Teams that keep an up-to-date changelog are often plagued by merge conflicts introduced by the `CHANGELOG` file. This tool was inspired by GitLab's [How we solved GitLab's CHANGELOG conflict crisis](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/07/03/solving-gitlabs-changelog-conflict-crisis/) article and the `README` over at [KiloKilo/changelog](https://github.com/KiloKilo/changelog).

## Installation

### [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint)

```sh
$ mint install pg8wood/changelog-generator
```

### Manual Installation
```sh
$ swift build -c release
$ cp -f .build/release/changelog /usr/local/bin/changelog
```

## Setup
1. Create a directory in your project in which to store your unreleased changelog entries. By default, the tool looks in `./changelogs/unreleased`. This may be changed with the `--directory <path>` option.
2. Create your changelog file if it doesn't exist. By default, the tool looks for `CHANGELOG.md`. Use the `--changelog-filename <path>` option to customize.
3. Add `<!--Latest Release-->` to the top of your changelog file. This anchor helps the tool parse previous releases when using the `publish` subcommand. It is not rendered by Markdown viewers. See [this project's changelog](https://github.com/pg8wood/changelog-generator/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for an example.
4. If you'd like your changelog to contain a header before latest release, create `changelogs/header.md` (or use a custom markdown file and specify the `--header <path>` option) and add your header text as Markdown. This project's [changelog header](https://github.com/pg8wood/changelog-generator/blob/main/changelogs/header.md) is prepended to the [changelog](https://github.com/pg8wood/changelog-generator/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) with each release.
