> Curbing Cumbersome Changelog Conflicts

A tool that creates changelog entries and stores them as unique files to avoid merge conflicts in version control. When it's time to release, `changelog publish` collects these files and appends them to your changelog file.

## Why?
Teams that keep an up-to-date changelog are often plagued by merge conflicts introduced by the `CHANGELOG` file. It was inspired by GitLab's [How we solved GitLab's CHANGELOG conflict crisis](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/07/03/solving-gitlabs-changelog-conflict-crisis/) article and the `README` over at [KiloKilo/changelog](https://github.com/KiloKilo/changelog).

## Installation

```sh
$ mint install pg8wood/changelog-generator
```

## Usage
### Help
To view all the available options, run `$ changelog help`

### Log a New Change
Changelog entries may be added interactively with your favorite text editor, or quick entries can be passed as command-line arguments.

```sh
$ changelog log addition "I added something cool" "And something boring"

### Added

- And something boring
